React Node Socket.io File Uploader is an open-source file uploading application built using React, Node.js, and Socket.io. It allows users to easily upload files by dragging and dropping them onto the designated area. The uploaded files are then sent in chunks to the Node.js server using Socket.io, enabling real-time progress updates during the upload process.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop:** Users can intuitively drag and drop files onto the designated area for uploading.
- **Real-time Progress Updates:** The application provides live progress updates, allowing users to track the upload status of their files.
- **Efficient Chunk-based Transfer:** File data is transferred to the server in smaller chunks, ensuring efficient and reliable uploading.
- **Seamless User Experience:** The frontend is built with React, offering a smooth and interactive user interface.
